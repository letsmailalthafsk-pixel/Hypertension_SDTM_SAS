Project Title: 
“SDTM Conversion and Standardisation of Hypertension Study Data – Valsartan
Hydrochlorothiazide.” 
Project Description: 
As part of my SAS training, I worked on converting raw clinical trial data into CDISC 
SDTM-compliant datasets for a Phase II hypertension study involving adult subjects treated 
with CO-DIOVAN (Valsartan-Hydrochlorothiazide) across multiple sites in India. 
The raw data included information on demographics, vital signs, exposure, adverse events, 
medical history, concomitant medications, trial design, and patient-reported assessments. 
Using SAS, I successfully created 14 SDTM domains—DM, EX, DS, MH, CM, SU, SC, VS, 
TA, TV, TI, AE, QS, SV, and SE. 
Key activities undertaken during this project included: 
• Created unique subject identifiers, sequence numbers, and baseline flags using SAS 
DATA step, with functions like CATX, SUBSTR, INPUT/PUT and IF-THEN-ELSE 
logic. 
• Standardised variable names, formats, and units according to CDISC SDTM 
guidelines, using PROC SQL, MERGE, and BY-group processing for accurate 
alignment. 
• Organised clinical measurements, exposure data, and visit information to maintain 
correct study timelines, applying WHERE statements, conditional logic, and arrays. 
• Imported raw datasets using LIBNAME, INFILE, and PROC IMPORT, and 
exported the final SDTM datasets with PROC EXPORT. 
• Automated repetitive tasks and ensured consistency across domains with SAS macros, 
improving efficiency and reliability. 
This project strengthened my practical understanding of SDTM implementation and enhanced 
my SAS programming skills, giving me hands-on experience in clinical data standardisation 
and preparation for real-world clinical programming tasks.
